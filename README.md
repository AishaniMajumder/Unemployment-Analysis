# Unemployment Rate Analysis in India

# Problem Statement

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted global economies, leading to a sharp increase in unemployment rates. Understanding the fluctuations in unemployment can provide valuable insights for policymakers, businesses, and researchers. This project focuses on analyzing the unemployment rates in India over several years, identifying trends and patterns that emerged during and after the pandemic.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and contains unemployment statistics in India. It includes various attributes such as:

- Date: The date of the recorded unemployment data.
- Estimated Unemployment Rate (%): The estimated percentage of the unemployed population.

# Solution Overview

The solution involves the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Import the necessary libraries and load the unemployment dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Strip any leading or trailing spaces from column names to avoid potential issues.
   - Convert the `Date` column to a datetime format, ensuring that any parsing errors are handled appropriately.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Extract the year from the `Date` column for annual analysis.
   - Calculate the mean unemployment rate for each year by grouping the data based on the extracted year.

4. **Result Visualization**: The analysis results will be displayed, providing insights into the average unemployment rates over the years, highlighting any significant trends or anomalies.

# Conclusion

This analysis provides a clearer picture of how unemployment rates have evolved in India, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The insights gained can inform further research and contribute to more effective economic policies moving forward.
